# C_Programming Assignment

# Description
This assignment involves solving several programming problems using the C language.
The problems are designed to test my understanding of fundamental concepts in C programming, including data types, control structures, functions, pointers, arrays, and strings.

# Assignment Questions
# Question 1: Fibonacci Number
Write a function fibonacci that takes an integer n as a parameter and returns the nth Fibonacci number.<br>
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:<br>
. F(0) = 0<br>
. F(1) = 1<br>
. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1<br>

# Question 2: Print Alphabets
Write a function alphabets that takes two characters c1 and c2 and prints all the alphabets starting from c1 to c2 in a single line.

# Question 3: Substring Extraction
Write a function substring that takes a string s and two integers L and R, and returns the substring of s from index L to R.

# Question 4: Prime Factorization
Write a function printPrimeFactorization that takes an integer N and prints its prime factorization.

# Question 5: Update Variable
Write a function updateVar that takes a pointer to an integer and increments the value of the integer by 10.

# Question 6: Special Array
Write a function isArraySpecial that takes an array of integers and checks if every pair of adjacent elements contains numbers with different parity.

# Question 7: Transpose of a Matrix
Write a function transpose that takes an N x N matrix and returns its transpose.

# Instructions <br>
. Clone the repository or download the files.<br>
. Implement each function in the corresponding C file.<br>
. Ensure your code is properly commented and follows good coding practices.<br>
. Compile and test your code using a C compiler.<br>
Submit your completed assignment as per the submission guidelines provided.
